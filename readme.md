# Three.js & GSAP audio visualization boilerplate

Boilerplate for audio visualization with Three.js & GSAP. Combining these two tools with the audio API make it easy to visualize music accross a timeline. Three.js does the heavy lifting to render stuff with WebGL. GSAP allows to create timelines holding all state so there is no need to do checks in the 'render loop' yourself. The boilerplate also includes Babel and webpack so that modules and ES6 syntax can be used.
